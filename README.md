## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar. 

`Consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.`

### Step 1:

```npm
npm install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.console.log('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```

```javascript
const s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
console.log('hello world');
```

`Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.`
