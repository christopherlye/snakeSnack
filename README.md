## Inspiration

<p align="justify">I wanted to create a browser game that people are thoroughly familiar with, but with a twist. The initial idea was to create a Tron-like single player game where the player will navigate an arena with a vehicle which leaves a trail that acts as an obstacle for both human and AI players.</p>

<p align="justify">However, as it turned out quite challenging for my first project, I decided to take on something more manageable as a prototype. So I developed a snake game which employed a similar logic for such a game and made it two players at the moment, removing the need to code the AI logic, while allowing family and friends to have fun together.</p>

<p align="justify">Riding on the popularity of the fast food chain, Shake Shack, this two-player game, Snake Snack, was born. 🤓</p>

## Approach

In summary:

1. Decide on platform
   - Found out how browser games are created
   - Determined the method used (e.g. DOM manipulation, HTML canvas, phaser.io, melonjs.org)
   - Decided on HTML canvas to scope my game and not have it all over the screen
2. Create game logic using MVP concept
   - Created a box in the canvas
   - Added motion to the box based on event listeners
   - Created various objects and game engine
   - Created one snake using an array
   - Created collision logic
   - Extended to two snakes
3. Style the game
   - Changed snake colours
   - Added sound clips during eating, collision, winning
   - Customise a gif using piskel
   - Refining of overall app
